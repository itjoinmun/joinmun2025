    explanation:
      "The passing of United Nations General Assembly Resolution of 64/289 saw the formation of UN Women as the main UN agency in tackling women&apos;s issues. UN Women plays a significant role in redefining global norms relating to gender equality. UN Women&apos;s support for legal recognition through mechanisms such as the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), as well as advancing national legislative changes in favour of ending violence and gender inequality through legally binding mechanisms and criminalisation strategies.<br /><br /> This council acts as a critical forum for addressing some of the world&apos;s most pressing gender-related issues, from legal inequality to economic marginalisation and gender inequality. As a council, UN Women do not just respond to violations of women&apos;s rights, instead, we shape a global discourse and discussions about gender issues, lobby for equality through legislation, and break systems of oppression through informed diplomacy and policy making. It is time that delegates take an active role in charting the future of gender justice.",

      "<b>Invisible in Law: The Struggle for Legal Recognition of Transgender and Non-Binary Identities</b><br /><br />In many parts of the world, transgender and non-binary people continue to be left in a state of legal invisibility, effectively deprived of the basic right of self-identification within the legal system. As of 2024, fewer than 30 states provide comprehensive legal recognition based on self-determination. Meanwhile, many others impose degrading and invasive conditions, such as forced sterilisation, psychiatric diagnosis, or surgical procedures, practices condemned by international human rights bodies. This denial of legal recognition violates core principles under human rights law, including the right to privacy, legal personality, protection against discrimination, and protection from inhumane treatment. <br><br>The legal implications of such invisibility status are far- reaching. Without recognition and legitimate identification documents, trans and non-binary individuals are often denied basic access to life, exposed to systemic exclusion, and placed at greater risk of violence. UN Women has increasingly addressed gender identity under its intersectional gender mandate, advocating for legal reforms that respects the right to self-expression, placing pressure on states to end medicalised and gender duality- based approaches in regards to legal gender. Delegates are called to navigate through the complexities of delayed justice by recognition of self-identity.",

      "The World Health Organization (WHO) exists to lead and coordinate international health within the United Nations system. It serves as the principal authority on global health, tasked with improving public health outcomes, responding to emergencies, and setting international health standards. WHO guides nations in building resilient health systems, provides technical support, and promotes universal health coverage through its global influence.<br /><br />Founded on the vision of attaining the highest possible level of health for all peoples, WHO&apos;s core functions include: shaping the health research agenda; monitoring and assessing health trends; providing leadership during crises; and coordinating partnerships and international responses. Structured through the World Health Assembly, the Executive Board, and the Secretariat, WHO engages 194 Member States under one vote each, ensuring collective, transparent, and accountable decision-making. Amid evolving threats, WHO remains an important forum for knowledge exchange, outbreak preparedness, and sustainable development alignment, enabling global solidarity and strategic response in the face of complex health challenges.",

      "<b>Barriers to Healthcare Access: The Global Impact of Insurance Denials and Systemic Inequities</b><br /><br />In today’s fractured geopolitical climate, health has emerged not only as a humanitarian issue but also as a matter of global security and diplomacy. In many regions affected by conflict and instability, the collapse of medical infrastructure, population displacement, and direct attacks on health workers have triggered widespread health emergencies. The World Health Organization (WHO) plays an essential role in navigating these humanitarian crises, upholding its commitment to medical neutrality and equity in care.<br /><br />The Council must deal with competing narratives and political stances as it addresses the global implications of healthcare insurance denials, particularly in light of the recent controversy involving UnitedHealthcare and its CEO, Luigi Mangione. The revelation that thousands of insurance claims were allegedly denied without proper medical review has exposed systemic flaws in healthcare systems where profit often precedes patient care. While some states emphasize the urgency of protecting public health and ensuring equitable access, others tread carefully around legal accountability and corporate regulation issues. This divergence challenges the WHO to uphold its commitment to medical neutrality while also asserting moral leadership in condemning practices that undermine the right to health. As public trust erodes and health disparities deepen, the Organization must reinforce its operational credibility and ethical stance, advocating for transparency, justice, and patient-centered policies. In doing so, delegates are urged to craft a unified, strategic response that transcends political divides, confronts structural injustices, and restores dignity to those failed not only by conflict but by the very systems meant to protect them.",

    explanation:
      "The six committees of the United Nations General Assembly were formed simultaneously in its first session, nearly 75 years ago. These committees are but faces of UNGA; they share the same universal membership, pass resolutions under the mother council’s name, follow a single set of rules of procedures and execute a specific area of the UNGA’s diverse mandate. It is through these committees that the UNGA fulfills its duties as outlined in the Charter of the United Nations.<br /><br />In exercising its mandate on issues of international economics, the UNGA acts through its Second Committee, known more popularly as the Economic and Financial Committee (ECOFIN) or C2. Despite its name, ECOFIN&apos;s authority encompasses a vast array of thematic clusters, from macroeconomics and development financing to food security and even the sovereignty of Palestinians over their own resources. Thus, the C2 has played an instrumental role in the pursuit of general prosperity around the world, especially in resolving crises on basic human necessities such as the housing crisis in coordination with U.N. Habitat.<br /><br />Now, in a world wracked by post-pandemic recessions, spiralling inequality and renewed economic rivalries, this committee must stand and act even more resolutely than ever before.",

      "<b>The Global Housing Crisis: Growing Affordability Struggle Amidst Rates Hikes</b><br /><br />The 2007 subprime mortgage crisis did not merely scorch Wall Street, it cremated the global economy. Behind this meltdown were systemic financial and regulatory flaws; the results? banks extended credit to high-risk borrowers, firms recklessly bundled the loans into mortgage-backed securities and sold them globally. A bubble swelled and when it burst, the entire world paid the price. Central banks cut interest rates to near zero to stimulate the economy. But when demand returned in the 2010s, supply couldn’t keep up and housing prices climbed up steadily. Otherwise, though, throughout that decade, the world breathed a relieved sigh. Relatively.<br /><br />Then, came the COVID-19 Pandemic and the barely healed wounds of 2008 festered as economies ground to a halt. Governments and central banks launched more aggressive rate slashes to stimulate economic recovery. When inflation soared, driven in part by supply chain collapse, panic followed and the rates were dialled up. The hikes came like a gut-punch to consumers’ purchasing power as mortgages became much less accessible and demand cooled, but supply constraints kept prices in the sky. From this, a death cycle emerges: lower the rates and inflation returns; keep the rates high and the housing affordability crisis becomes progressively worse. Delegates thus must convene in a high-stakes session of the UNGA to prop up economic regulations, launch financial reforms, coordinate multilateral cooperation—anything that will kill this ouroboros of interest rates for good, all the while juggling their own niche needs, vulnerabilities and piping hot rivalries.",

      "“We have a shared responsibility to work for peace”<br />- Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations<br /><br />In the ongoings of international relations, peace and security exists as the ultimate target which states act upon, being a goal for all actions done by states and organizations. The United Nations is no different, with the pursuit and maintaining of peace being their crown objective being engraved in their founding document, the United Nations Charter Chapter 1 Article 1. In more severe cases, to ensure peace and security within the international atmosphere, the UN relies on one of their key organs– The United Nations Security Council. The United Nations Security Council exists to convene and discuss matters of international security, providing an internationally legally binding resolution to address any matters on their agenda. Per their mandate, the UNSC also exists to develop friendly relations among nations, cooperate in solving international problems and promote respect for human rights, and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations. During these discussions, consensus is of the utmost importance, as some nations– The United States, The United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China– reserve the right of veto, being able to cancel any resolutions the council produces. This complicates efforts of discussion and resolution-making due to the need for absolute consensus between the 5 polarizing nations. In any case, the UNSC remains a staple organization for global peacekeeping and exists as one of the most important parts of the whole UN system.",

      "<b>Discussing the complexities of the Sino-Indian Border Conflict: The Effects of Interpretations and Compliance to International Security</b><br /><br />What happens when international agreements get differently interpreted? How should states act when border lines get blurry?<br /><br />The Sino-Indian border crisis centers on the highly disputed Himalayan frontier, also known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which separates the nations of India and China. The roots of this crisis can be traced back all the way to colonial times and the legacy of colonial-era boundaries, which China never formally agreed to, leading to the 1962 Sino-Indian war. The aforementioned conflict established the LAC as a de facto border between the two states, however both parties remain in disagreement in the specific precise alignments, with interpretations differing by hundreds of kilometers. Over the decades, this disagreement and lack of clear definition has caused several military standoffs, with the most recent one occurring in June of 2020 in the Galwan Valley, where hand-to-hand combat between Chinese and Indian military personnel caused at least 20 casualties– causing international concern for the security in the region. The underlying motivations within this conflict are historical and strategic, with both nations compounding on national pride, interest, security, and regional influence. Another aspect that complicates this is each nation&apos;s development. China’s belt and road initiative and India’s growing ties with the United States have further intensified competition between the two. Infrastructure and military developments between the two can also be perceived as threats to each other&apos;s sovereignty. <br /><br />In this council, delegates must navigate the complex interplays between international law and sovereignty. This topic is certainly not an easy one, especially with both nations rejecting international interference. Both nations perceive the area as an opportunity to develop themselves and their regional influence, and it is up to the UNSC on how to treat them fairly and securely.",

      "<b>The Legacy of El Chapo: How the Mexican Cartel Crisis Continues to Shape Global Crime and Politics</b><br /><br />Fentanyl, heroin, smuggling, murder, weapon trafficking, and money laundering commence from Mexican territory, involving El Chapo and his rival cartels that are fighting for money and power. For years, Mexican cartels have been terrorizing both Mexico and American citizens with their infamous drug trade, bribery, human trafficking, and various other crimes. This violence includes fierce rivalries between Mexican cartels, all striving for control over money, fame, and, most importantly, drugs. The new elected president of Mexico in  2006 Felipe Calderón set out a promising future to rebuild and rehabilitate Mexico&apos;s government and law enforcers from corruption and potentially abolish the cartels in Mexico. In this crisis, delegates will take on the roles of several key figures, highlighting their decision-making skills, leadership, directives making, and negotiation tactics that could change the history of the Mexican cartel and the faith of the Drug lord himself El Chapo. Will the Mexican government succeed in its efforts? Could there be a push to promote and legalize the Mexican cartels? Might El Chapo and his allies dominate and reshape Mexico as a nation? Or will the U.S. take decisive action? The stakes are high, and the future hangs in the balance.",

Although the North is committed to preserving global stability, in reality, this is not the case. The United States, the so-called leader of the North for example, has launched many initiatives that threaten the global economic and political order such as trade wars and most recently, reciprocal tariffs. These actions not only threaten both the North and the South, but also increased the South&apos;s desire to challenge the North hegemony. The North visioned a more connected world. Meanwhile, various actions by the North has shown that the world now seems to be more fragmented than ever<br /><br />In the darkness, there is light.
